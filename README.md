## Grimm's Extended Tales ~ N-Gram Model
Generating a new tale from Grimms' Fairy Tales using the ```ntlk``` package.  All excerpts from the N-gram model can be found in the tales folder. Text is provided by Project Gutenberg- a free library of ebooks and text.

### Observations
- Grimms' Tales are strange and creepy no matter if it's machine or human writing it.
- Although this algorithm is using Trigrams, you can increase it to however many n-grams you'd like. Increase the threshold to better the chance of improved coherent sentences.
